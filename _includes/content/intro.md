> The exported `state` function will be used here in two ways: **(1) to define** structures called **state expressions**, which describe behavior in terms of methods, data, events, etc.; and **(2) to implement** a composite state expression on an `owner`, producing a tree of [`State`](#states-and-currency)s that belong to the owner and describe its potential exhibited behaviors.

> The *implementing* form has two effects: **(1)** the owner is given a new `state` method, which closes over the owner’s new state tree and serves as the **accessor** to its `State`s; and **(2)** for any method defined at least once in the state tree, a corresponding **dispatcher** method is created and added to the owner.

### [States and currency](#states-and-currency)

[`State`](/api/#state) objects are modules of behavior that may be exhibited interchangeably by their **owner** object. `State`s may define [method](#methods) overrides, arbitrary [data](/docs/#concepts--data), [event](#events) listeners, [guards](/docs/#concepts--guards), [substates](/docs/#concepts--object-model--superstates-and-substates), and [transition expressions](/docs/#concepts--transitions).

{% include examples/index--states--0.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--states--0.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

![States][diagram--states]

Exactly one `State` is designated as the owner’s **current state**, whose own and inherited behavior is exhibited by the owner.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--states--1.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--states--1.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

The owner may alter its behavior by undergoing **transitions**, which carry the current state reference, or **currency**, to a different `State`.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--states--2.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--states--2.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}


### [Object model](#object-model)

[`State`](/api/#state) objects may [inherit and be composed](/docs/#concepts--object-model) from other `State`s.

* Hierarchical single-inheritance is provided by the [**superstate–substate**](/docs/#concepts--object-model--superstates-and-substates) relation, which defines a **state tree** rooted from the **owner**’s unique **root state**.

* Compositional multiple-inheritance is provided simultaneously by [**parastates**](/docs/#concepts--object-model--parastates-and-composition). The parastate and superstate ancestors of a `State` are *C3–linearized* into a monotonic, unambiguous resolution order.

* Indirect prototypal inheritance is also defined by the [**protostate–epistate**](/docs/#concepts--object-model--protostates-and-epistates) relation, an implication of the owner’s prototype chain.

### [Attributes](#attributes)

[Attributes](/docs/#concepts--attributes) are a set of keyword strings that may precede the body of a state expression. These concisely empower or constrain certain aspects of a [`State`](/api/#state), such as [abstraction](/docs/#concepts--attributes--abstraction), [destination](/docs/#concepts--attributes--destination), and [mutability](/docs/#concepts--attributes--mutability).

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--attributes.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--attributes.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}


### [Methods](#methods)

[State methods](/docs/#concepts--methods) express or override behavior of the **owner**. Method calls received by the owner are dispatched to its **current state**’s own or inherited implementation of the corresponding method.

By default, state methods are invoked in the context of the owner, just like normal methods. To gain insight into its place in the owner’s state tree, a method definition can instead be [contextually bound](/docs/#concepts--methods--context) to the [`State`](/api/#state) for which the method acts. (This will be the `State` in which the method is defined, unless the method is inherited from a protostate, in which case the context will be the inheriting epistate.)

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--methods.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--methods.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

A state method can also be wrapped in a decorator that [fixes the method](/docs/#concepts--methods--lexical-bindings) with bindings to the precise `State` where it is defined (invariant across the protostate–epistate relation).


### [Events](#events)

**State** provides built-in [events](/docs/#concepts--events) that relate the [progress of a transition](/docs/#concepts--events--transitional) as it traverses the state hierarchy, along with events that signal the [construction, destruction](/docs/#concepts--events--existential), or [mutation](/docs/#concepts--events--mutation) of a [`State`](/api/#state). Events can also be emitted for any [custom event type](/docs/#concepts--events--custom).

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--events.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--events.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}


### [Mutability](#mutability)

[`State`](/api/#state) instances are nominally [immutable by default](/docs/#concepts--attributes--mutability). This restriction forces any changes in the owner’s **State**-based behavior to be expressed in terms of **transitions** between `State`s.

Alternatively, a `State` may be explicitly expressed as [mutable](/api/#state--attributes--mutable), such that modular pieces of behavior may be inserted and implemented dynamically into a live `State`, thereby allowing changes in behavior to be exhibited via **mutations** as well.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--0.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--0.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

> A free bit of behavior can be expressed with just a plain object.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--1.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--1.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

> This factory produces a boxed function that will instill an enclosed `behavior` into a receiving `State`.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--2.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--2.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}

> A `traveler` assimilates itself by overwriting previously defined behavior with the appropriately chosen new behavior.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--3.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight coffeescript %}
{% include examples/index--mutability--3.coffee %}
{% endhighlight %}


### [Transitions](#Transitions)

A [`Transition`](/api/#transition) instance is an ephemeral type of [`State`](/api/#state) that is automatically created and occupied as an owner’s **current state** while it is in the process of moving between `State`s.

[Transitions](/docs/#concepts--transitions) are defined by **transition expressions**, which are an optional component of a state expression. A transition may be defined [generically across multiple states](/docs/#concepts--transitions--expressions), is defined as either [synchronous or asynchronous](/docs/#concepts--transitions--lifecycle), and can be [conditionally guarded](/docs/#concepts--guards).
